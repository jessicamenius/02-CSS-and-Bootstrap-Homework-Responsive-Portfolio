            <h5>Who am I?</h5>
            <p>
              My name is Jessica. Orignally from the Midwest, I moved to SF in
              2014. I currently live in the Alamo Square neigborhood in the
              city. I work for Cisco Cloud Security in the Customer Success
              department.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a degree in Finance. And an MBA. I've worked in Finance,
              Recruiting, and now Customer Success. I love to try new things and
              am always learning something new.

            <h5>Why am I taking this course?</h5>
            <p>
              "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person
              will find an easy way to do it." - Bill Gates
            </p>
            <p>
              This quote has always inspired me. I'm not "lazy". However, I have
              always taken a look at what is being done and tried to figure out
              a way to make it easier and more efficient. Why do something in 12
              steps when you can do it in 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I want to learn to code. I want to be able to use ways
              to automate or make work much easier for myself. I also want to
              learn to code so I can speak intelligently with those who are
              doing the coding for projects I work on at work.

              The dog in my picture is Nugget. She's almost 12 years old and is
              the best dog in the world. You can tell she's super hip because
              she wears the coolest shades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nugget is a long-haired chihuahua. She's a cutie. She loves
              snuggles and belly rubs. She may be small, but she snores louder
              than anyone I've ever met. You may hear her sometime if I'm not
              muted in class.
